## Overview

A comprehensive spacecraft mission design project addressing NASA's heliophysics priorities and Moon-to-Mars communication challenges. Our team is designing one or more exploration assets to monitor solar and space weather phenomena while providing continuous Earth-Mars communication capability for future crewed missions.

> This project is based on the **2024-2025 AIAA Undergraduate Team Space Design Competition** guidelines.

## My Roles & Contributions

### Safety, Policy & Risk (SPR) - Lead

> Leading the risk management and safety analysis efforts for the entire mission architecture.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Develop comprehensive risk matrix quantifying risk across all spacecraft subsystems
- Evaluate cost, schedule, and risk tradeoffs for all subsystem trade studies
- Design contingency plans for critical failure modes
- Assess launch site and launch vehicle risks (coordinating with Propulsion)
- Analyze collision risk and orbital debris considerations (coordinating with Orbital Mechanics)
- Ensure spacecraft meets all safety requirements and operates within acceptable risk margins
- Review and validate trade study decisions across all subsystems

**Technical Work:**
- Risk identification, assessment, and mitigation planning
- Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
- Fault tree analysis for critical systems
- Safety compliance verification against NASA/industry standards

### Attitude Determination & Control Systems (ADCS) - Subteam Member

> Contributing to the spacecraft pointing and orientation systems, building on prior experience with CubeSat ADCS development.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Support attitude determination sensor selection and analysis
- Contribute to attitude control actuator trade studies
- Assist with pointing requirements derivation based on mission needs
- Coordinate ADCS interfaces with Command & Data Handling and Propulsion

**Technical Work:**
- Attitude determination algorithms (Extended Kalman Filter implementation)
- Sensor suite analysis (star trackers, sun sensors, IMUs, magnetometers)
- Actuator analysis (reaction wheels, magnetorquers, thrusters)
- Pointing accuracy and stability analysis for science payload and communication systems

**Relevant Prior Experience:**
- SPACE 584: CubeSat attitude determination and control systems
- Helmholtz coil calibration testing (achieved 168 uT magnetic field strength)
- Magnetorquer design and characterization
- Extended Kalman Filter development for attitude estimation
