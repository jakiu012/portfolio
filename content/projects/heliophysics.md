## Overview

A comprehensive spacecraft mission design project addressing NASA's heliophysics priorities and Moon-to-Mars communication challenges. Our team is designing one or more exploration assets to monitor solar and space weather phenomena while providing continuous Earth-Mars communication capability for future crewed missions.

This project is based on the 2024-2025 AIAA Undergraduate Team Space Design Competition guidelines.

**Course:** AEROSP 483 – Spacecraft Systems Design
**Institution:** University of Michigan
**Term:** Winter 2026
**Team Size:** 12 members

## Mission Objectives

- **Heliophysics Investigation:** Support the 2024 National Academies Decadal Survey priorities for solar and space physics research
- **Space Weather Monitoring:** Detect and monitor solar weather phenomena to enable early warning systems for crewed missions
- **Earth-Mars Communication:** Provide line-of-sight communication capability between Earth and Mars throughout the full synodic cycle (2036–2049)
- **Crew Safety Support:** Enable space weather alerts for astronauts in transit to/from Mars, on the Martian surface, and on the lunar surface

## Mission Constraints

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Budget | ≤ $400M USD (FY25) |
| Launch Date | No later than December 31, 2035 |
| Operational Period | 2036–2049 (late 2040s EOL) |
| Communication | Near-constant Earth-Mars line-of-sight |

## My Role & Contributions
