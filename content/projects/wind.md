## Overview
Prototyped a small HAWT targeting locally sourceable materials and basic tools.

## Approach
- Bench: load sweeps across RPM
- Analysis: efficiency vs. TSR; voltage vs. frequency
- Mechanical: coupling stress sizing; budget breakdown

## Results & Outcomes
- **Power:** ~0.1–0.17 W
- **Max efficiency:** ~1.2%
- **TSR:** ~2.5
- Clear path to improve blade profile and alternator coupling

## What I’d Improve Next
Airfoil selection, tip-loss correction, and generator matching.

## Overview
Proof-of-concept horizontal-axis wind turbine for rural Guatemala. Built with locally sourceable materials, passed rooftop safety checks, and successfully lit the test lightbox. Final prototype stood ~154 cm tall with three ~80 cm blades on a wooden/PVC structure and a self-yawing fin.

## Approach
- **Bench and electrical:** Load sweeps across RPM, voltage vs electrical frequency for multiple phase/resistor configs; wiring routed inside the shaft to avoid tangling.
- **Analysis:** End-to-end efficiency vs wind speed and tip-speed ratio (TSR); compared measured power to theoretical wind power.
- **Mechanical:** Wood base with elevated support and cross-base; pillow-block + bearing assisting the motor shaft; hinged hub door for access; budget tracking.

## Results & Outcomes
- **Power:** ~0.10–0.17 W measured
- **Max efficiency:** ~1.2% at low wind (~1.1 m/s)
- **TSR:** avg ~2.5 (range ~0.1–7.2)
- **Budget:** ~$110 total materials
- **Safety & demo:** Passed inspections and illuminated the lightbox

## What I’d Improve Next
- Aerodynamics: proper airfoil, tapered chord/pitch toward the tip, identical balanced blades, tip-loss correction.
- Drivetrain: add a simple gear ratio (e.g., ~1:3) to raise shaft speed; better shaft coupling; switch to a metal shaft.
- Structure: move/strengthen the upper support, larger yaw bearing, fully enclosed weatherproof hub.
- Controls & safety: phase-short braking for safe stops.
- Sustainability: use recycled plastics or alternative coverings; refine bill of materials for cost and durability.
