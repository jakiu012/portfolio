description: "Self-yawing horizontal-axis wind turbine built with accessible materials; passed rooftop safety checks and powered the lightbox."
---

## Overview
Built a self-yawing horizontal-axis wind turbine using accessible wood, PVC, and 3D-printed parts; three 80 cm blades; turntable yaw bearing with vane; trap-door hub for maintenance; routed wiring through the hollow shaft; delivered a working prototype within a $110 budget.

## Design Features
- **Blades**: Three 80 cm blades on wooden/PVC structure
- **Yaw system**: Turntable bearing with self-aligning vane
- **Hub**: Trap-door access for maintenance
- **Wiring**: Routed through hollow shaft to avoid tangling
- **Height**: ~154 cm total

## Safety Verification
Passed five rooftop safety checks:
- 300 N lateral load test
- High-wind disassembly attempt
- Passerby safety test
- Technical requirements verification
- Roof integrity check

## Testing & Instrumentation
- Instrumented tests across resistive loads and phase configurations
- Measured voltage vs. frequency for multiple phase/resistor configs
- End-to-end efficiency vs. wind speed and tip-speed ratio (TSR) analysis
- Compared measured power to theoretical wind power

## Results & Outcomes
- **Max efficiency**: 1.2% at ~1.12 m/s (average 0.546%)
- **Tip-speed ratio**: Average 2.5 (maximum 7.2)
- **Power**: 0.10–0.17 W measured
- **Max voltage**: 6.453 V
- **Budget**: $110 total materials
- **Demo**: Successfully powered the lightbox to reveal the message

## Recommendations
- Higher gear ratio (e.g., ~1:3) to increase shaft speed
- Larger rotor radius to capture more wind power
- Proper airfoil profile with tapered chord/pitch toward tip
- Metal shaft with better coupling
- Phase-short braking for safe stops
